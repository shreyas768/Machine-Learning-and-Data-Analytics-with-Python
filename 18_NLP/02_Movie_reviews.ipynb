       "how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres ? \\r\\nisn't there a law or something ? \\r\\nthis diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg's dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst . \\r\\nmouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat-out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison . \\r\\nwriter adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill . \\r\\nthe plot , for what its worth , concerns two brothers ( nathan lane and an appalling lee evens ) who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father . \\r\\ndeciding to check out the long-abandoned house , they soon learn that it's worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder . \\r\\nbut battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse , happy with his run-down little abode and wanting it to stay that way . \\r\\nthe story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe . \\r\\nwhatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue , terrible overacting , and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury , signifying nothing . \\r\\nthe script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is : \" i hate that mouse \" . \\r\\noh cringe ! \\r\\nthis is home alone all over again , and ten times worse . \\r\\none touching scene early on is worth mentioning . \\r\\nwe follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall . \\r\\nhe jumps into a tiny bed , pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep , seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone . \\r\\nit's a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film . \\r\\na message to speilberg : if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility , then either give all concerned in mouse hunt a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors . \\r\\nthis kind of rubbish will just not do at all . \\r\\n

       "one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . \\r\\nafter all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . \\r\\nhe is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . \\r\\nhowever , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . \\r\\nthe abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . \\r\\nthese four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . \\r\\nit is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : \" it's only when things are over that they make sense . \" \\r\\nwhether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . \\r\\nthe thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . \\r\\ninstead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last . \\r\\nonly once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you're so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it . \\r\\nbut don't fret , it will surface again . \\r\\nyou could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile . \\r\\nbut you hold hope for some time . \\r\\nthe background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . \\r\\nit's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope . \\r\\nand with speeches like , \" i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , \" how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ? \\r\\nto godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . \\r\\nthe black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . \\r\\nwatching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . \\r\\nand if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . \\r\\nthe environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them . \\r\\nunfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene . \\r\\nsometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . \\r\\nthe second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image . \\r\\nyou suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . \\r\\nthe only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . \\r\\nsteven spielberg is picked on in particular . \\r\\nwhile i'll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it's still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . \\r\\nit just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . \\r\\nthe days of breathless are no more . \\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

       " \" love is the devil \" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline . \\r\\nwatching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter . \\r\\neverything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film's subject , looked at it personally . \\r\\nbut while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on . \\r\\nexactly what was i looking at ? \\r\\nwatching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous . \\r\\ndirected ( and written ) by john maybury , \" love is the devil \" is stylish masterpiece for the senses . \\r\\neverything looks originally bizarre and perplexing . \\r\\nthe camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close . \\r\\nthe editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche . \\r\\nas such , there is no real story . \\r\\ni've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like . \\r\\nhe was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty . \\r\\nas played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero . \\r\\nhe lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him . \\r\\nit's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( \" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , \" he says one night at the bar he frequents ) . \\r\\n \" love is the devil \" chronicles the latter part of his life . \\r\\nbacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor . \\r\\nhe walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) . \\r\\nbacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning . \\r\\ngeorge agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason . \\r\\nthe film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another . \\r\\nwhile creating bacon's world of friends ( like \" high art , \" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant . \\r\\nbacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn't understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings . \\r\\nwhile watching this , that's basically all i thought was there . \\r\\nthe film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about . \\r\\nonce the film is over , it's easier to piece it together . \\r\\ni kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was . \\r\\nsomeone doesn't merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in . \\r\\nthinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother . \\r\\ni thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer's head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein's \" battleship potemkin \" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain . \\r\\nhe drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn't for george . \\r\\ni guess that explains the title . \\r\\na bit . \\r\\nthat's great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning . \\r\\ni wish it hadn't reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) . \\r\\nor maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man's twisted pysche . \\r\\nit's almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man's uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience's throat . \\r\\nthat way you don't reduce your film to something it's just not . \\r\\ni can't say i totally enjoyed \" love is the devil , \" though . \\r\\ndespite all of the things i respect about this movie , it's still rather uncomfortable to sit through . \\r\\neven at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour . \\r\\nthough hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man's truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it . \\r\\nas such , i respect the way the film looks . \\r\\nit's beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with \" what dreams may come \" and \" dark city , \" it's the year's most visually stunning film . \\r\\nin fact , if a better script had been forged , i'd almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever . \\r\\nand with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs . \\r\\ni just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance . \\r\\nthen i would have had something to hold me over even now . \\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

       "one of the responses those that enjoy \" detroit rock city \" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : \" oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us . \\r\\njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? \" \\r\\ni'm wondering the same thing . \\r\\ni feel like i should have had a grand time with \" detroit rock city . \" \\r\\nit's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't . \\r\\ni just didn't . \\r\\nsurely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? \\r\\nno , but i expected something . \\r\\na funny joke . \\r\\na clever prank . \\r\\na plot development . \\r\\nanything . \\r\\nthe movie never delivers . \\r\\nyou've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \\r\\n \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization . \\r\\nthe film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . \\r\\nthat's it . \\r\\nthere is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . \\r\\nthe characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . \\r\\nthey have a garage band . \\r\\nthey're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . \\r\\nthey have tickets , they lose them . \\r\\nthey get more tickets , they lose those too . \\r\\nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . \\r\\nthere's not much more to it . \\r\\nfrankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . \\r\\noh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . \\r\\nshe doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already . \\r\\nit's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . \\r\\nwe've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . \\r\\nthen again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \\r\\n \" detroit rock city \" doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . \\r\\nin fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . \\r\\nbasically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up ) . \\r\\nit's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . \\r\\nedward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood . \\r\\npeople wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . \\r\\ntoo bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . \\r\\ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . \\r\\nwe get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . \\r\\nit's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . \\r\\ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . \\r\\ni haven't felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" \\r\\nand what about that script ? \\r\\nit's written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i've ever heard . \\r\\nif it is , i can't say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \\r\\na plotless , pointless rock n' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \\r\\nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \\r\\nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \\r\\nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \\r\\nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don't provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \\r\\nit's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? \\r\\nfunny ! \" \\r\\nlook , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . \\r\\nsee ? \\r\\nfunny ! \\r\\nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . \\r\\ntwice . \\r\\nsee ? \\r\\nfunny ! \\r\\nlook , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . \\r\\nsee ? \\r\\nfunny ! \\r\\na word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren't funny all by themselves . \\r\\nthey must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn 't predicted them five minutes in advance . \\r\\nthat's it , i've said enough about this movie . \\r\\nit's a waste of time and money . \\r\\ni liked the music , but don't bother buying the soundtrack . \\r\\ni hear it' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . \\r\\nyou want to see this concept executed well ? \\r\\ngo rent roger corman's 1979 classic \" rock n' roll high school . \" \\r\\nit features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show . \\r\\nyes , go rent that , and skip \" detroit rock city , \" which will probably bomb , and deservedly so . \\r\\n     1\n",
       "weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg's reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches . \\r\\nthere ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics . \\r\\nspielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story . \\r\\nbut for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken . \\r\\nin this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films . \\r\\n_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a \" pr mission \" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day . \\r\\nryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers . \\r\\nthe search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france . \\r\\nthere's no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie . \\r\\nthe equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done . \\r\\nthe opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat . \\r\\nanother pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg's brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops . \\r\\nthe technical side of the film is peerless , as always . \\r\\nthe camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw . \\r\\nhanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel . \\r\\nyet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events . \\r\\nit has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince . \\r\\nthroughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) . \\r\\nfor example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground . \\r\\nhere and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there's an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man . \\r\\nbut the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact . \\r\\nthere are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) . \\r\\nthe relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film . \\r\\nultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war . \\r\\nrather than saying _saving private ryan_ is \" realistic , \" it would be better to describe it as \" having realistic moments . \" \\r\\nanother aspect of the \" hollywoodization \" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing . \\r\\nanyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell's superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup . \\r\\n \" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? \" \\r\\nasks one infantrymen in the group of eight . \\r\\nrendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as \" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ?

       "a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn' . \\r\\nfollowed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer . \\r\\nthen i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u . s . . . . . unique . . . excellent . . . . must-see . \\r\\nwell , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here . \\r\\n'here' , of course , was still three months away . \\r\\ni'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow . \\r\\ni'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list . \\r\\nthat , let me tell you , has changed completely . \\r\\ni knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet . \\r\\nthe acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick . \\r\\nseriously . \\r\\ni've never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie . . . . . sorry , \\r\\nmake that 'roles' in the movie . \\r\\neven travolta's great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage's character portrayals . \\r\\nmy favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler's hideout . \\r\\nhalf drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son's death from castor's perspective - \" doesn't it just break your heart . \" he mutters coldly . \\r\\nnow don't go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it's not . \\r\\nthat's what really makes this movie unique . \\r\\nit's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters . . . . . not a common mix at all . \\r\\nsuspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though . . . . . that's \\r\\nthe only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other . . . . and \\r\\nnever hit . \\r\\nseveral action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press 'rewind' and watch it over again . \\r\\nthe part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant . \\r\\nwhilst cage's and travolta's performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies , the lesser characters are just as intriguing . \\r\\njoan allen , who usually sticks to the straight drama movies , plays her part perfectly as archer's long suffering wife . \\r\\ni like the fact that her character didn't end up toting a gun at the end of the movie . . . it \\r\\nwould have wrecked her potrayal . \\r\\ngina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy's mistreated girlfriend . . . . . make that * one of * castor troy's mistreated girlfriends . \\r\\nother movies would have used her character as just window dressing . . . a \\r\\nsex object , but instead her character is very strong and independent . \\r\\ndominique swain , who plays archer's daughter , also does a nice job , though her character is not as explored as much as allen's or gershon's . \\r\\nfaults ? well . . . there were some i have to say . \\r\\nfirst , the movie's ending , whilst being very good overall , was a bit too drawn out for it's own good . \\r\\nafter the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can't help but think - \" geez , are you guys nuclear powered or what ? \" . \\r\\nthere were certain bits that weren't handled properly , like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform/prison - more explanation here would have been nice . \\r\\noverall , this movie was not perfect . \\r\\nbut i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect . \\r\\nmany critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made . . . . . i \\r\\ncertainly hope so . \\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
